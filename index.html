  <h3 class="post-title">Flipping Birdman off</h3>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Rapper Birdman walked out of his interview with The Breakfast Club on April 22, 2016, after just over two minutes,
       claiming the hosts, specifically myself, were not "putting respect on his name".
       Birdman was angry at the hosts allowing artists such as Trick Daddy
       and Rick Ross to appear on the show and make disparaging remarks about him.</p>
       <p>
       I questioned why Birdman was angry at me and not the artists themselves,
       but he left the interview after just over two minutes.
       The interview went viral and resulted in numerous memes based on the incident.
        It is the shortest interview in Breakfast Club history..</p>

    <p>If somebody would have told me a week a go that
      I would be able to make a website I would have been excited
